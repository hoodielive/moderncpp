### Vectors
1. Similar to arrays in that they store collections of elements continuously in memory, 
   but vectors have dynamic sizes. This means that we don't need to know their size at
	 compile time; we can just define a vector and add/remove elements at will. Given this
	 they manage their size(s) carefully.
