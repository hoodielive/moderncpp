A Variable

- A name
- A type
- A value
- A location in memory ("memory address")

Variables live on a STACK.


Stack memory
By default, every variable in C++ is placed in stack memory.

Stack memory is associated with the current function and the memory's lifecycle 
is tied to the function:

When the function returns or ends, the stack memory of that function is released back to the
system.
