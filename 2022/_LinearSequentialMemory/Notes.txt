An array stores data in block of sequential memory.

Arrays have a limitation in C++.
1. They can only contain 1 type.

When you think of it, its genius given that we can always be sure that the size and type will Always remain the same.

- Consider an array of 6 Cube objects.
- Using the sizeof(Cube) function we find each is 8bytes large.

long array[6] { 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10 };


- What is the offset to index 8?

8x8 = 64 bytes


2. Has to have a fixed capacity.
- Arrays must store their data sequentially in memory.
- The capacity of an array is the maximum number of elements that can be stored.
- The size of an array is current number of elements stored in the array.
- An array is full when the size of the array is = to the capacity.
- The only way to add another element is to allocate a new, larger array and copy over all of the data.
